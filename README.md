# üçé Fruit Freshness Classification using EfficientNet-B0

This project uses a trained **EfficientNet-B0** deep learning model to classify fruits as **fresh** or **rotten**.  
It works in **real-time via your laptop camera** or by **uploading fruit images**.

Supported **10 classes**:

1. freshapples  
2. freshbanana  
3. freshmango  
4. freshoranges  
5. freshtomato  
6. rottenapples
